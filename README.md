**Important!** This repository contains a *partial* compiler that converts Medusa programs to intermediate code that cannot be ran on your machine. [Please check out this repository for a real compiler that compiles Medusa programs directly to executable files!](https://github.com/ewelborn/Medusa-Programming-Language-Classic)

# Medusa Programming Language

Medusa is a programming language that I designed by hand for my Programming Language Fundamentals course during my undergraduate degree. In addition, I wrote a compiler using Java to compile Medusa into intermediate code, ready to be translated into machine language for whatever target platform the user likes.
